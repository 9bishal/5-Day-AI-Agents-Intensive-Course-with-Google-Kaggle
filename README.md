🎉 Completed the 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google & Kaggle!

I’m excited to share that I’ve officially completed the 5-Day AI Agents Intensive — a completely free, hands-on program built to help developers design, build, and deploy the next frontier of AI: autonomous agentic systems.

This course wasn’t just theory; it was a deep practical dive into how modern AI agents think, act, collaborate, and function in real production environments.
Over these five days, I had the chance to explore everything from core agent fundamentals to advanced multi-agent designs that work together to solve complex tasks.

🔥 What I Learned Throughout the Program

📘 Day 1 – Introduction to Agents
Understanding the foundations of autonomous systems and how agents operate in dynamic environments.

🧰 Day 2 – Tools & Interoperability (MCP)
Learning how agents take real-world actions through external tools and APIs using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

🧠 Day 3 – Context & Memory Engineering
Building short-term and long-term memory to create agents that stay coherent, contextual, and stateful across tasks.

🔍 Day 4 – Agent Quality
Diving into observability, tracing, debugging, and evaluation frameworks to ensure agents are reliable and production-ready.

🤝 Day 5 – Prototype → Production with A2A Protocol
Exploring the Agent2Agent (A2A) communication protocol to create scalable, collaborative multi-agent systems.
